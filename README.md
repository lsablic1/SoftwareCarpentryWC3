WC3 - Website

This is me trying to make a website using github pages. I have the instructions. I have google. But it still took me a million back and forths trying to add, commit and push (in that order) to the online repo. As of now I have survived part 1 and am halfway through part 2, which is exciting. If everything goes well I will be submitting this masterpiece to blackboard before dinner. Wish me luck!

# Software Carpentry Weekly Challenge 3
Making a Website

Hello!

This is me trying to make a website using github pages.


I have the instructions.

I have google. 

But it still took me a million back and forths trying to add, commit and push (in that order) to the online repo. As of now I have survived part 1 and I'm halfway through part 2, which is exciting.
If everything goes well I will be submitting this masterpiece to blackboard before dinner.

Wish me luck!


UPDATE: Made it! I can now eat in peace.
